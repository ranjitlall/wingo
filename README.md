# World of International Non-Governmental Organizations (WINGO) Database 

The World of International Non-Governmental Organizations (WINGO) database is a comprehensive catalogue of formal international non-governmental organizations (INGOs). The dataset, which encompasses more than 2,600 organizations, is based primarily on the Yearbook of International Organizations, a wide-ranging reference work on international organizations published by the Union of International Associations (UIA). It additionally includes original information on INGOsâ€™ founding dates, dissolution dates, headquarters locations, and issue areas.

The database, which is available in CSV format, was introduced in my article "Making Global Governance Accountable." Please use the following citation:

Lall, Ranjit. 2023. "Making Global Governance Accountable: Civil Society, States, and the Politics of Reform." _American Journal of Political Science_.

The data are accompanied by a codebook that provides a detailed description of all variables in the WINGO dataset, including their definition, scale, and sources.
